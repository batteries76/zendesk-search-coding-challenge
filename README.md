### Specs
Using ruby 2.5.0
Using RSpec 3.8


- different display options
- different ways to hold the data
- different places to extract the data
- I am assuming that the fiuelds are the same, even if the data does not exist
- domain names and tags
- created_at etc and dates and search
- trying to make code dry trade-offs
